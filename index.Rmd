## Summary of the project

Photosynthesis by terrestrial vegetation is the primary driver of many 
biogeochemical cycles on Earth. Quantifying photosynthesis and thus the 
amount of carbon fixed (Gross Primary Production) is essential to understand 
the ecosystems health, global change, biodiversity and agriculture.

The principal method to estimate GPP is Eddy Covariance technique which is a
method in-situ which have an spatial constrain. Satellite remote sensing techniques
can overcome spatial constrain but uncertainties are higher.

This research evaluates the estimations of GPP obtained from the Moderate 
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with GPP estimations obtained through
Eddy Covariance technique in a tropical dry forest in Santa Rosa National Park,
Costa Rica.

Trends of GPP obtained from MODIS did not match the patterns and seasonality of
GPP estimated in-situ. Results of regression between NDVI derived from MODIS and
GPP estimated in situ was statiscally significant (R2 = 0.84, F(1, 28) = 152.26,
p \< .001, adj. R2 = 0.84) and higher than the linear model between EVI derived 
from MODIS and GPP estimated in-situ (R2 = 0.79, F(1, 28) = 102.72, p < .001, 
adj. R2 = 0.78). Residuals derived from both linear regression did not show any
pattern within the months available for the study. A direct gradient analysis
showed that the driest months were related more with air temperature and
vapour presure deficit. GPP, EVI and NDVI derived from MODIS were more 
influenced by relative humidity, latent heat and soil water content in months
with higher values of precipitation.
