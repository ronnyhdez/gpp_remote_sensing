      "contents": "\n\n\n\nHome (~200 words) Title – Aim for a short, descriptive and catchy title. This could be your main research question, e.g. “Does clearcutting really affect tree density?” or your main finding: “Cearcutting reduces tree density to zero”. Avoid uninformative titles such as “The effect of this … on that …”. Summary – In plain words, describe what you want to accomplish with your study. Two or three sentences why your objective/question is important. Two or three sentences about your research approach: summarize your sampling procedure/experimental design/analysis. Two or three sentences about your results: describe your main findings in a concise and quantitative way (I observed a 20% decrease of tree density under the 1/5th harvesting treatment). End with your main conclusion. Visual Elements – Use a photo or another visual element that represents your research topic.\n\n\n\n\n",
