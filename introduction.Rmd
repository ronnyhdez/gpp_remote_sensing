2. Intro (~500 words)

Background & Rational – Describe the context of your research (background), why is it important or interesting
(rationale). Do a minimal review of the literature with relevant references as a foot-note or in a reference section.

Research Objectives – State one or more research questions, applied objectives,
or scientific hypotheses in more detail than in the summary. Are there practical
applications of your research? Do you want to decide between two or more 
management options? Or do you have a true scientific hypotheses in a sense of 
two or more competing explanations that you want to investigate? 
Stating an interesting research question or applied objective is just as good 
in this section (but be sure you can actually meet the objectives and answer 
those questions with your data!). 


Expected results – Describe the expected results and possible alternative 
results of your study. Explain how different results would help you to decide 
between different management options, or how the results would help you to 
answer a research question or test a hypothesis through exclusion of competing
explanations.


Visual Elements – In this section, you may use simplified, conceptual graphs or 
diagrams to support your background narrative, or to illustrate what the 
possible outcomes of your study might be. You can also add photos from your 
research or potential applications as decoration.
